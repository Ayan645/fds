/*
Theory:

This program implements a priority queue using an array-based approach, where elements are inserted in order based on their priority.
1. **Priority Queue**:
   - A priority queue is a special type of queue where each element is associated with a priority.
   - Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority.

2. **Key Operations**:
   - **Enqueue (Insertion)**: Adds an item to the queue, maintaining the order based on priority.
   - **Dequeue (Removal)**: Removes the item with the highest priority.
   - **Display**: Shows the current elements in the queue along with their priorities.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Insert elements in sorted order after every insertion to ensure higher priority elements are at the front.
   - For deletion, remove the front element, as it has the highest priority.

4. **Applications**:
   - Process scheduling in operating systems.
   - Handling tasks in real-time systems.
   - Pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s.

5. **Example**:
   - Input: `["Task1", 2], ["Task2", 1], ["Task3", 3]`
   - Queue: `|Task2-1| Task1-2 | Task3-3|`
   - Dequeue: Removes `Task2`.
